Here we present an extension of our simple algorithm that perform contractions with the same alphanumeric indical functionality.\n",

The somewhat tricky bit lies in the fact that, for example, upon contraction, the product $v(m,f,n,e)t_2(n,e,a,j)$ produces $c(m,f,a,j)$ after reshaping, DGEMM multiplication, and unravelling. Suppose we want to produce the output tensor of a specified permutation, say $c(f,a,j,m)$. Now, the string $mfaj$ must be permuted into the desired order held in the variable 'strC' (in this case $fajm$). So the function intermediate_output_str(indA_un, indB_un) produces the string $mfaj$ using the uncontracted indices. The function return_output_indices(c, strC) compares the string $mfaj$ to the desired ordering e.g. $fajm$ and produces the index permutation to be used with np.transpose() that permutes the resulting tensor product into the desired ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the following code does not support self-contractions within individual tensors. For example, it could not evaluate the expression $v_{ii}^{mn}t_{mn}^{ef}$ since the first tensor has a contraction over its own indices (although one could add this functionality without too much trouble!).
