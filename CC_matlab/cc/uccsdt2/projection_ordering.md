Due to the new Mac OSX's stupid case-insensitive filesystem, we are going to refer to projections in the way
that they are listed in the build_system_uccfunction:

t3A:
Projection 1 - PPPHHH
Projection 2 - PPpHHH
Projection 3 - PPPhHH
Projection 4 - PPphHH

t3B:
Projection 1 - PPPHHH
Projection 2 - PPpHHH
Projection 3 - PpPHHH
Projection 4 - PPPHHh
Projection 5 - PPPhHH
Projection 6 - PPphHH
Projection 7 - PPpHHh
Projection 8 - PpPhHH
Projection 9 - PpPHHh

t3C:
Projection 1 - PPPHHH
Projection 2 - PPpHHH
Projection 3 - pPPHHH
Projection 4 - PPPHhH
Projection 5 - PPPhHH
Projection 6 - PPpHhH
Projection 7 - PPphHH
Projection 8 - pPPHhH
Projection 9 - pPPhHH

t3D:
Projection 1 - PPPHHH
Projection 2 - PPpHHH
Projection 3 - PPPhHH
