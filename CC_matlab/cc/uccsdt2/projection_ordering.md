Due to the new Mac OSX's stupid case-insensitive file system, we are going 
to refer to projections in the way that they are listed in the build_system_ucc function:

For UCCSDT(II) active-space partitioning:

Projection 2 - PPpHHH [DONE]
Projection 3 - PPPhHH [DONE]
Projection 4 - PPphHH [DONE]

t3B:
Projection 1 - PPPHHH [DONE]
Projection 2 - PPpHHH [DONE]
Projection 3 - PpPHHH [DONE]
Projection 4 - PPPHHh [DONE]
Projection 5 - PPPhHH [DONE]
Projection 6 - PPphHH [DONE]
Projection 7 - PPpHHh [DONE]
Projection 8 - PpPhHH [DONE]
Projection 9 - PpPHHh [DONE]

t3C:
Projection 1 - PPPHHH [DONE]
Projection 2 - PPpHHH [DONE]
Projection 3 - pPPHHH [DONE]
Projection 4 - PPPHhH [DONE]
Projection 5 - PPPhHH [DONE]
Projection 6 - PPpHhH [DONE]
Projection 7 - PPphHH [DONE]
Projection 8 - pPPHhH [DONE]
Projection 9 - pPPhHH [DONE]

t3D:
Projection 1 - PPPHHH
